{"idx": 1, "truncated_input": "\"Whoever gets him, they'll be getting a good one,\" David Montgomery said.\nINDIANAPOLIS \u2014 Hakeem Butler has been surrounded by some of the best wide receivers on the planet this week at the NFL Scouting Combine.\nIt\u2019s an experience that might humble some. But for Butler, it has only enhanced his confidence.\nAs it stands, 22-year-old Butler is not regarded as the best wide receiver in this year\u2019s NFL Draft. He\u2019s projected by some experts to go as late as the third round. But when wide receivers were measured Thursday, Butler gained some attention: He led all receivers in height (", "baseline_completion": "6-foot-5 3/8), arm length (35 1/4 inches) and wingspan (83 7/8 inches).\nOn Thursday, running back David Montgomery, who played with Butler at Iowa State, captured the general vibe surrounding Butler here.\nButler says he\u2019s met with every NFL team on an informal basis. He had \u201cnine or 10\u201d formal meetings set up for Friday night, but didn\u2019t divulge which teams he\u2019d be sitting down with.\nThere is clear interest in Butler, who declared for the draft after his junior season in which he had 60 receptions for 1,318 yards and nine touchdowns.\nBut in his mind, the hype machine hasn\u2019t been turned up high enough \u2014 yet.\nButler, of course, is talking about Saturday\u2019s wide receiver workouts. If he crushes the drills, he could vault up the draft board \u2014 perhaps into the first round. And he feels well-prepared because he\u2019s spent the past few months working out with some legendary NFL receivers in Calvin Johnson and Anquan Boldin.\nButler met Boldin at the South Florida gym where he trains. He was connected to Johnson through his agent.\nJohnson and Boldin are known for being precise, tactical receivers. But Butler says the most valuable lesson of working with them has been learning about how they think.\nButler admitted the first time he worked with Johnson, who went to six Pro Bowls with the Detroit Lions from 2010-15, that he was a little starstruck.\nButler is hoping that one day he can leave a legacy like Boldin or Johnson. But for now, his goal is to prove what he already believes is true: that he is the top receiver in this draft.", "orig_sample_length": 548, "prompt_length": 148, "real_completion_length": 400, "no_bl_gen_time": 242.15753269195557, "w_bl_gen_time": 242.77529120445251, "no_bl_output": "6-foot-5 1/2) and hand size (11 1/4 inches).\n\u201cI\u2019m not surprised,\u201d Butler said. \u201cI\u2019ve been working on my hands.

Butler\u2019s wingspan is longer than that of Harry, D.K. Metcalf and A.J.

He was a basketball star at his high school in Missouri and played basketball for one season at Iowa Western Community College. Butler played football in high school but didn\u2019t play it in college until he arrived at Iowa State.\nHe was a four-star recruit coming out of high school and was offered by several Power Five programs.

In 2017, he led the Big 12 in yards per reception (20.5) and was third in the conference in yards per game (72.5). He was named a freshman All-American by Pro Football Focus.\nButler was a second-team All-Big 12 selection in 2018.

{"idx": 3, "truncated_input": "The Arlington County Board plans to vote Saturday afternoon on giving Amazon $23 million and other incentives to build a headquarters campus in Crystal City, but only after hearing scores of northern Virginia residents and advocates testify for or against the project.\nThe five-member board is expected to support the plan, which was announced amid much hoopla on Nov. 13. The proposed county incentives are part of an agreement in which Amazon would occupy significant office space and bring at least 25,000 high-paying jobs to Arlington in coming years.\nOpponents hope to postpone the vote until after additional public hearings, where they want representatives of the online retail giant to answer questions directly from anyone in the community.\nThe Saturday hearing was scheduled to begin no earlier than 1 p.m. and last several hours before the vote. Ninety-one people signed up in advance to speak on the topic.\nIn the four months since Arlington won a much-publicized, nationwide contest to attract the facility known as HQ2, Arlington residents have been asking questions about its impact on their community.\nPeople have looked at the county\u2019s five online Q&A sessions 14,000 times, and about 400 attended community events to discuss the provisions in the Amazon agreement. Board members and county staff also met with scores of civic organizations, served on multiple panels and appeared on television, online and in news articles to discuss the deal.\nMost Arlingtonians, northern Virginians and residents of the Washington region support Amazon\u2019s arrival, several surveys have found. Business organizations, universities and nonprofit groups came out strongly for the deal.\nBut a small, vocal group of activists has sought to block the project, saying that the county and commonwealth should not give any incentives to one of the world\u2019s most valuable companies. They also have demanded housing and job protections for existing residents.\nThese opponents \u2014 including left-wing organizations and immigrants groups \u2014 felt empowered after Amazon canceled plans last month to build a headquarters facility in New York City, also with 25,000 jobs. The company withdrew after criticism of the plan from some elected leaders, unions and community activists.\nIn Virginia, however, such opposition did not appear to catch fire among the broader public.\nOfficials estimate that the Amazon project\u2019s net fiscal impact on Arlington could be worth additional revenue of $162 million over 12 years and $392.5 million over 16 years.\nThe incentives agreement promises the world\u2019s largest online retailer cash grants estimated at about $", "baseline_completion": "23 million if it occupies 6.05 million square feet of office space in Crystal City and Pentagon City through 2035.\nThe money would come from an expected increase in the hotel, motel and lodging tax paid by visitors; Amazon would get up to 15 percent of that increase, pegged to how much floor space is in active use by the company each year from 2020 to 2035.\nAmazon\u2019s offices will be located within an already-established special tax district where a portion of the property tax revenue goes toward infrastructure improvements such as parks and wider sidewalks.\nThe incentive agreement says that half of any new revenue from that district starting in 2021 will go specifically toward improvements around the Amazon buildings for the following 10 years. That grant is worth an estimated $28 million but the county says it\u2019s not a grant just for Amazon, because the improvements will benefit other companies in the immediate area. Amazon will have a chance to express its opinion on how the county uses the money, although the board will make the decision.\nThe county also offered Amazon the possibility of using its fast, fiber-optic network connection, which would be the subject of a separate agreement if the company chooses to use it.\nIt\u2019s not yet clear whether Amazon will pay the local business license tax because that tax is levied only on certain types of business, and Amazon has not yet announced which of its business units will be based in Arlington.

{"idx": 10, "truncated_input": "This month some important Walmart news did not get the attention it deserved. The news wasn't some flashy announcement about virtual reality or about some new service for busy Manhattanites. It was something much more subtle and much more substantive.\nIt was the hire of Valerie Casey. Google \"Valerie Casey\" even today and only two listings make mention of her newfound connection with Walmart on the first page of the returned search results. This amount of attention is unjustifiably slight. Let this piece then serve as the hire's coming out party.\nShrewdly, Walmart has made Valerie Casey, formerly of Frog, Ideo, and Pentagram, its new head of design. She will be charged with leading Walmart into the future and ensuring that all its products and services, from websites to employee and consumer apps, will work in cohesion and from a singular experience design point of view.\n\"What's the big whup?\" you might ask.\nThe big whup is that this announcement clearly shows that Walmart has jumped feet first into the waters of next generation retailing. Under Doug McMillon's bold leadership, Walmart here again is taking one of the most essential steps to long-term success for any legacy bricks-and-mortar retailer\u2014specifically, redefining how it thinks of the word \"product.\"\nInstead of doing what many retailers do, like staffing de facto \"product\" heads within owned brand development, store operations, e-commerce, etc. and then leaving them to collaborate inside complex organizations with competing priorities, Walmart rightly understands that retailing has become so complex that all these aforementioned roles now need their own steward to ensure alignment.\nWalmart having a mission to help its customers save money and live better is one thing, but putting that promise into coherent action is another thing entirely. Many retailers take such coordinated action for granted, which is why so many legacy retail experiences feel disjointed across the digital and physical divide. Success rarely is found in the compromise and turf wars of internal politics. The buck needs to stop somewhere.\nPrior to e-commerce, before customers had the myriad of options they have today to consume products (via web portals, apps, social media, etc.), retailers were able to differentiate themselves by the products inside their four walls. The strategic practice of product differentiation became so prevalent and such a point of emphasis that it even gave way to the commonly heard parlance of retail being a \"merchant-led business.\"\nThe growth of e-commerce in the 1990s and 2000s rewrote the playbook though. During this period, Jeff Bezos built Amazon into the \"Everything Store.\" His idea was that as long as he could offer a great selection, convenience and great prices, consumers would gravitate towards Amazon over time. Boy, was he right, and, boy, did they ever gravitate towards Amazon.\nWhether customers try to order direct from Amazon or from one of Amazon's many third-party suppliers on its marketplace, it is becoming more and more difficult for a consumer not to find what he or she desires on Amazon. At this point, nearly 50% of all first product searches start on Amazon, indicating that Amazon is settling into the digital and product acquisition-equivalent of the 1980s shopping mall. The products inside a retailers four walls or within a retailers assortment are now, in a way, almost non-differentiating.\nBezos saw that the opportunity in retail was to put the customer first and to think not about the product he or she buys but about the Product he or she really buys\u2014for him, the Product (big \"P) of the Amazon brand. The white space in retail was no longer leading with product (small \"p\"), but leading with the discipline of Product Management, where his Product, or in this case, the Amazon brand, was the magic created at the intersection of great experience design, technology and business. Product was not a pair of khaki pants, a new set of bed sheets or a bar of soap. It was the culmination of a friction-free user experience that delivered on the universal truths of selection, convenience, and low prices and that exceeded consumers' expectations consistently, again and again.\nSadly, many retailers have not grasped this \"Product Problem.\" The greatest Product Manager in history, Jeff Bezos, saw the problem early on, while many merchant princes missed the signals and have even now admitted that they underestimated the impact technology would have on retail. Fortunately, Walmart's recent hire of Casey indicates that there could be light at the end of what has, until now, been a dark tunnel.\nWalmart is big. The acquisitions of Jet", "baseline_completion": ".com, Bonobos, ModCloth, etc. have only made it bigger and more complex, saying nothing too of the ever-changing demands of consumers and Walmart's ever-expanding interests abroad (see Flipkart). Therefore, it is only right that someone, like Casey, take up the mantle to oversee and to fight for the consumer and to ensure that all Walmart's activities look, feel, and convey the Walmart brand in the simplest, most straightforward way as possible.\nThe products inside Walmart's stores are immaterial to its future success. What matters is the Product of its brand\u2014its website, its store, its app-based services, etc. Those are the Products that matter. In a future world where the only thing that differentiates a physical from a digital experience is the memory and delight of being somewhere, a Walmart store is the Product or collective set of experiences that will get someone off his or her couch.\nA tube of toothpaste just won't cut it anymore.\nWhile the products within Walmart's store or on its website will come and go and ebb and flow, the shroud of the Walmart brand will be what matters. Walmart's store and its digital properties will be the envelopes that carry its brand promise.\nThe experiment that bears this out has already been run. We need look no further than the history of Amazon and also to the young upstart CEOs like Emily Weiss, Katrina Lake and Adam Goldenberg who are already thriving in this new world. Their collective early success indicates that they get the punchline to the joke of 21st century retail\u2014that the retail of the future won't be merchant led, it will be Product led.\nBest of luck, Valerie Casey.

{"idx": 12, "truncated_input": "The Linux kernel now includes everything that is needed to use 3D acceleration with all GeForce graphics chips. Drivers have also been added for a Wireless Gigabit chip and a PCIe WLAN chip from Realtek.\nIn his email announcing the release of Linux 3.8-rc6, Linus Torvalds emphasised that he wanted the seventh release candidate to be the last one. When he released RC7 on Friday, however, he made no mention of whether there would be an eighth RC before the final version of Linux 3.8.\nAs long as no more major problems arise, though, the Linux kernel 3.8 should still be released this month. This article on driver updates will therefore bring the \"Coming in 3.8\" Kernel Log mini-series to a close. The first two parts of the series focused on the changes that kernel developers made to filesystems and storage and the platform and infrastructure code for Linux 3.8.\nIn Linux 3.8, the Nouveau kernel driver will include everything that the OpenGL driver \u00e2\u0080\u0093 which is part of current versions of Mesa 3D and is also called Nouveau \u00e2\u0080\u0093 needs to use the 3D acceleration of all GeForce graphics chips available so far without further configuration. This is the first time that the Nouveau developers, who use reverse engineering to get the information they need to program their drivers, have managed this feat; before this, they were still lacking standard 3D support for some newer Fermi GPUs and the Kepler graphics chips, which have been on the market since March 2012 (1, 2, 3). For many computers, however, NVIDIA's proprietary graphics driver will still be a better choice, since Nouveau can't activate the faster operation modes for many of the newer GeForce chips, resulting in 3D performance that leaves something to be desired. There are also other issues, particularly when it comes to video acceleration and fan management support.\nVersion 3.8 of Linux is the first to include a simple kernel graphics driver for the graphics cores in NVIDIA's Tegra\u00c2 2 and 3 SoCs (system on a chip) (1, 2, 3 and others). The driver is not from NVIDIA; it was developed mostly by a developer from the German company Avionic Design. The company works on embedded solutions in close cooperation with NVIDIA and programmed the driver independently, but with input from NVIDIA. Surprisingly, NVIDIA jumped into the development process, publishing extensions a few weeks ago that let the driver make the graphics cores' acceleration features available, but these improvements did not make it into 3.8. Userland drivers are still needed to use the acceleration functions, and NVIDIA has yet to give any indication that it is interested in releasing those drivers under an open source licence. Nouveau developer Lucas Stach shared background information on the Linux drivers for NVIDIA's Tegra in a presentation at FOSDEM 2013, a recording of which is available on YouTube.\nThe Radeon driver now allows more of the graphics cores' DMA engines, which have previously been largely ignored, to be used from userspace (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). The i915 graphics driver now supports by default the graphics cores of the Haswell processors that Intel will introduce under the name Core i4000 in a few months. The developers have also included a workaround for a bug in the Intel 830 and 845 chipsets so the graphics drivers are supposed to be stable on these chipsets.\nThe virtio_net network driver, which uses paravirtualisation and is especially used with KVM and Xen, should provide better performance now that it can use multiple queues for each network device. The same goes for the Tun/Tap driver, which is also used for system virtualisation as well as other purposes like emulating network hardware.\nThe batman-adv (Better Approach To Mobile Ad-Hoc Networking Advanced) mesh implementation developed as part of open-mesh.org to spontaneously create WLAN networks can now build a distributed ARP table, which allows non-mesh clients on a network to receive quick, reliable answers to their ARP queries.\nThe rtl8723ae driver for the Realtek RTL8723AE PCIe WLAN chip is new (1, 2 and others), as is the wil6210 driver for a Wilocity WLAN chip that operates at 60GHz and uses the IEEE 802.11ad standard promoted by the Wireless Gigabit Alliance (WiGig).\nAnother addition to the kernel is the ar5523 driver, which was started over five years ago for the Atheros USB chipset of the same name. Extensions for supporting more chips and WLAN adapters were added to a number of other drivers; the brcmsmac WLAN driver, for example, now supports the BCM43224 Broadcom chip, while the rt2800usb RaLink driver supports the Sweex LW323 USB WLAN adapter.\nThe cdc-mbim driver, which supports broadband modems that implement Mobile Broadband Interface Model (MBIM ) 1.0, specified by the USB Implementers Forum, is also new (1, 2). MBIM is a USB protocol for connecting modems for laptops, tablets and desktop computers that provide an internet connection using GSM and CDMA-based ", "baseline_completion": "3G and 4G (including LTE). Aleksander Morgado provides more details on the protocol and its advantages compared to other technologies in a blog post.\nThe kernel's audio drivers now support the Philips PSC724 Ultimate Edge sound card. The kernel can also handle VIA's VT1705CF HD audio codec now. The merge listing the most important changes to Linux 3.8's sound subsystem includes some other changes to audio drivers.\nThe kernel now includes a driver for human interface devices (HIDs) that use I2C (1, 2 and others), using the \"HID over I2C\" protocol designed by Microsoft and implemented in Windows\u00c2 8. Extensions were added to the HID multitouch driver to support some of the features for better finger and movement recognition found in Windows\u00c2 8.\nThe drivers for Video4Linux\u00c2 2 (V4L2) located in the media subsystem can now use the \"DMA Buffer Sharing Mechanism\" (dma_buf) integrated in Linux 3.3 to share buffer space with graphics cards, which makes it possible that data from video hardware will no longer need to be duplicated in the buffer in order for a graphics chip to display it.\nThe kernel developers have marked the uas driver, which handles the USB Attached SCSI protocol, as broken because it causes problems and is not yet ready for the major distributions.\nAlan Cox has given up kernel development for family reasons, leaving his position as maintainer of the serial driver subsystem. Cox is a Linux veteran who maintained the Linux kernel 2.2, during which time he was considered the second most important kernel developer after Linus Torvalds. Although he hasn't been that far up in the ranks these last few months, Cox has still contributed quite a lot to the development of Linux.", "orig_sample_length": 1628, "prompt_length": 1228, "real_completion_length": 400, "no_bl_gen_time": 308.1977753639221, "w_bl_gen_time": 310.09104657173157, "no_bl_output": "3G and 4G mobile networks.\nThe Linux kernel now includes a driver for the Intel 82579LM Gigabit Ethernet chip, which is used in the Intel Ethernet Converged Network Adapter X540-T2.

The event was 5,000 million times more powerful than an atomic bomb.\nScientists don't know exactly what triggers such eruptions.

{"idx": 14, "truncated_input": "Last summer I took a cross-country road trip with a group of people driving different types of electric vehicles.\nIt was an amazing experience, and our trip, our adventures, and our misadventures were portrayed in the documentary Kick Gas.\nThat experience gave me the idea to take my own road trip to experience the freedom of traveling alone on an electric motorcycle.\nMy goals were simple: ride the great motorcycle roads of America, meet other electric motorcycle riders, and visit friends.\nThe cross-country trip last summer taught me that charging stations are plentiful near cities, but sparse near the good roads. By \"good roads\" I mean the mountainous, twisty, curvy, windy, fun roads you dream about when buying a motorcycle!\nTo take road trips in an electric vehicle as easily as in a gas-powered vehicle, two things are necessary: a car with a highway range of 150-plus miles, plus DC fast charging available every 50 miles. That would be a good beginning as we await an affordable 1,000-mile battery.\nCurrently drivers must rely on the availability of public and private charging stations to venture further than half the range of their electric vehicle. This creates a bit of an adventure if you want to take a journey of, say, 4,000 miles.\nPublic charging stations are easiest to access. On the East Coast, you can show up at a charging station and pretty much expect that nobody else will be plugged in.\nThat's not the case in California, which has a much higher density of electric vehicles--at least some of them already using the charging station you've just arrived at.\nMy favorite public charging stations are at restaurants, so I have a place to eat and relax while my vehicle is charging. On this trip, I stopped at several Cracker Barrel restaurants in Tennessee and a Makuto's Japanese restaurant in Boone, North Carolina.\nCar dealerships will let motorcycles charge, although not always electric cars of another make. Nissan in particular has outfitted their dealerships with 240-Volt Lvel 2 chargers, and more recently, some of them now have high-powered CHAdeMO DC fast chargers.\nEven dealerships that normally only allow charging by cars sold by that dealer will allow me to plug in my electric motorcycle, since it's unique. Some dealers happily let me charge, others let me charge after a little conversation.\nStill, recharging my electric bike at a car dealer proved less than ideal, since they're often far from food or anywhere interesting to hang out.\nPersonal homes are fun if you plan ahead. I've met some interesting folks who make their home Level 2 charging stations available to travelers by listing them on the PlugShare app. They are lovely people, and meeting them is a fun part of being an early adopter.\nClearly, though, using someone's home charging station is not a sustainable way to propel electric vehicles forward.\nThe fun riding part of my journey began in Front Royal, Virginia, on Skyline Drive going through the Shenandoah Mountains. The road winds its way around the mountaintops and was designed as a sightseeing project by the Civilian Conservation Corps during the Great Depression of the 1930s.\nAfter a great day on Skyline Drive, I got to ride through the back woods around Blacksburg, Virginia, until I reached the glorious Blue Ridge Parkway. The road is absolutely incredible, flowing through farmland and mountains on either side for miles and miles.\nI made a brief stop in Asheville to swing -dance to bluegrass music with friends from Italy; I rode to the top of Mt. Mitchell, and then I headed to the best motorcycle road in America, known as the Dragon.\nAfter riding the Dragon, I headed to Nashville to visit some electric-motorcycle friends, and we headed down the famous Natchez Trace Parkway. This is another phenomenally beautiful road with scenic stops and meandering curves that caress the local terrain.\nThe first half of my journey ended in St. Louis, where I attended my cousin's wedding and visited the Country Music Hall of Fame. My trip was broken up because I had to fly back to New York City for a week, but I'll resume today--traveling to Chicago, Cleveland, and Rochester, New York, on my way to ride up New Hampshire's Mount Washington.", "baseline_completion": "\n1) It's still an adventure to take an electric-vehicle road trip (unless you're driving a Tesla using the company's Supercharger network).\n2) While it's easy to find charging stations, they're not always guaranteed to be available. They could be in use already, not working at all, or--worst of all--they might be \"ICEd,\" or blocked by a thoughtless driver of an internal-combustion engine (ICE) car.\n3) Most people at RV campgrounds are super-nice! I've shown up to many campgrounds unannounced, and most were incredibly welcoming and let me recharge my motorcycle for free (even though I always offer to pay the dollar or so for the electricity).\n4) To take a road trip in any electric vehicle, you need to plan ahead. At the start of each day, I decided where my stops for charging would be--including alternate locations if available.\n6) A couple of RV parks have claimed that they needed to replace receptacles to their 50-Amp hookup after a Tesla used it. This should be further investigated, as electric-vehicle owners very much don't want to burn those bridges or create any distrust of our community on the part of park owners.\n7) When I learn a Tesla has stopped at an RV park, the park operators will often ask me for $10 or more to recharge (my bike uses maybe $0.60 of electricity). This highlights the fact that most people have no idea how much electricity costs--and no one understands how much electricity different electric vehicles use. My motorcycle battery holds one-tenth the energy of a Tesla battery, so the cost for electricity is a factor of 10 less--but I often have to explain that slowly and carefully.", "orig_sample_length": 1373, "prompt_length": 973, "real_completion_length": 400, "no_bl_gen_time": 290.5217342376709, "w_bl_gen_time": 286.5730423927307, "no_bl_output": "\nI'll be back in New York City on July 15, and I'll be riding the Tail of the Dragon again on July 18.\nI'm having a blast, and I'm learning a lot about the state of electric vehicles.\nI'm also learning that the best way to charge an electric vehicle is to plug it into a 240-Volt Level 2 charger at a restaurant or a friend's house.\nI'm also learning that the best way to charge an electric vehicle is to plug it into a 240-Volt Level 2 charger at a restaurant or a friend's house.\nI'm also learning that the best way to charge an electric vehicle is to plug it into a 240-Volt Level 2 charger at a restaurant or a friend's house.\nI'm also learning that the best way to charge an electric vehicle is to plug it into a 240-Volt Level 2 charger at a restaurant or a friend's house.\nI'm also learning that the best way to charge an electric vehicle is to plug it into a 240-Volt Level 2 charger at a restaurant or a friend's house.\nI'm also learning that the best way to charge an electric vehicle is to plug it into a 240-Volt Level 2 charger at a restaurant or a friend's house.\nI'm also learning that the best way to charge an electric vehicle is to plug it into a 240-Volt Level 2 charger at a restaurant or a friend's house.\nI'm also learning that the best way to charge an electric vehicle is to plug it into a 240-Volt Level 2 charger at a restaurant or a friend's house", "w_bl_output": "\nThe trip is a little more difficult because the weather is turning colder and the days are shorter.\nI've had to change my plans a bit to accommodate the cold weather.

{"idx": 19, "truncated_input": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Could the U.S. lose its top credit rating even if a deal is reached to raise the debt limit?\nMarket analysts and investors increasingly say yes. The outcome won't be quite as scary as a default, but financial markets would still take a blow. Mortgage rates could rise. States and cities, already strapped, could find it more difficult to borrow. Stocks could lose their gains for the year.\n\"At this point, we're more concerned about the risk of a downgrade than a default,\" said Terry Belton, global head of fixed income strategy at JPMorgan Chase. In a conference call with reporters Tuesday, Belton said the loss of the country's AAA rating may rattle markets, but it's \"better than missing an interest payment.\"\nEven with a deadline to raise the U.S. debt limit less than a week away, many investors still believe Washington will pull off a last-minute deal to avoid a catastrophic default. Washington has until Aug. 2 to raise the country's $14.3 trillion borrowing limit or risk missing a payment on its debt. President Barack Obama and Congressional Republicans have failed to reach an agreement to raise the debt ceiling and pass a larger budget-cutting package. Politicians have tied raising the debt limit and spending cuts together.\nBut at least one credit rating agency has already made it clear that unless that agreement includes at least $4 trillion in budget cuts over the next decade, the country's AAA rating could be lost. Right now, the proposals under discussion cut around $2 trillion or less.\nStandard & Poor's warned earlier this month that there was a 50-50 chance of a downgrade, if Congress and President Obama failed to find a \"credible solution to the rising U.S. government debt burden.\" S&P said it may cut the U.S. rating to AA within 90 days. Passing a $4 trillion agreement could prevent a downgrade, S&P said.\nThe other chief rating agency, Moody's Investors Service, said the U.S. government would likely keep its top rating if it avoids a default.\nSpokesmen from both Moody's and S&P said they wouldn't comment beyond their recent reports.\nJPMorgan's Belton said clients have started asking how markets will respond if the U.S. loses its AAA rating. A drop to AA will mean permanently higher borrowing costs for the U.S. government, he said. And because government lending rates act as a floor for other lending rates, mortgages, student loans, corporate debt and other types of loans will become more expensive.\nBelton estimates that borrowing costs would rise between 0.60 to 0.70 points. That may not sound like much. But mortgage interest rates, which have hovered around 4.5 percent for the last several weeks, could rise by at least that amount, to more than 5.1 percent.\nAnd for the federal government, it eventually means an extra $100 billion in interest payments to Treasury holders like China each year.\n\"That's a huge number,\" Belton said. That $100 billion a year that could be spent elsewhere", "baseline_completion": " on everything from education to infrastructure.\nAn increase in interest rates could soon become a drag on other parts of the economy, experts say. State governments and insurance agencies would also be downgraded \u2014 and states are already having financial troubles. Business confidence could sink again, leading to prolonged high unemployment.\nBut some investors aren't unhappy about the thought of a U.S. debt downgrade. Don Quigley, manager of the $1.5 billion Artio Total Return Bond fund reasons that such a move could provide a buying opportunity. He believes that a downgrade would immediately send the yield of the 10-year bond up to 3.15 percent from its current level of about 3 percent.\nIf the economy sinks further in part because of higher interest rates, investors would very likely return to buying bonds, Quigley said. That's what they've done during the last several years both during the financial crisis and recession, and again the last several months as the economic recovery has slowed.\nTreasurys would keep their allure, in part, because there are few alternatives for large foreign buyers looking for a market big enough to handle massive investments.\n\"The German market is not big enough and Japan has its own problems,\" Quigley said.\nA cut to the U.S. credit rating could hit stocks harder than bonds. A study by Janney Montgomery Scott looked at rating changes to countries over the past decade. After Spain was downgraded in 2009, Spain's stock market fell 8 percent in three months. A cut to Japan's credit rating in 2011 knocked the country's stock market down 3.4 percent in three months.

The Dow is up 12.5 percent since Obama took office in January 2009. The market is still down 12.5 percent from the high it hit in 2007 before the financial crisis.\nBut the market is also at risk. If the U.S. loses its AAA rating, the stock market could fall by as much as 10 percent, Hoyt said. That would wipe out the gains for the year.\nThe U.S. government has a AAA credit rating, the highest possible, from all three major ratings agencies. It's the only country with such a high rating.\nA downgrade would be a blow to the U.S. reputation as a stable borrower. It could also lead to a downgrade of other government agencies, like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the housing finance companies that are owned by the U.S. government.\nA downgrade would also likely mean that the U.S. would lose its status as the world's most popular currency. The dollar has been the world's currency of choice since the end of World War II.\n\"The U.S. dollar has been the world's reserve currency for 70 years,\" Belton said. \"That would be a huge blow.\"", "no_bl_num_tokens_generated": 400, "w_bl_num_tokens_generated": 400, "no_bl_sec_per_tok": 0.685473347902298, "no_bl_tok_per_sec": 1.4588459245866, "w_bl_sec_per_tok": 0.6854445397853851, "w_bl_tok_per_sec": 1.4589072375032752, "baseline_loss": 1.9061064720153809, "baseline_ppl": 6.726846694946289, "no_bl_loss": 0.49081480503082275, "no_bl_ppl": 1.6336467266082764, "w_bl_loss": 0.8771809935569763, "w_bl_ppl": 2.4041130542755127}

It was called the J.E.Young Academic Center (JEY). It provided an educational sanctuary for the very students FUSD is trying to corral with this Restorative Justice debacle.\nEvery student was treated \u2013 educationally and emotionally \u2013 as a unique individual. JEY accepted the entire spectrum of students; from those whose special needs could not be adequately met, to those whose behaviors could not be adequately accommodated on a traditional high school campus. This program was an oasis for students on the precipice of failure.\nIt was a wonderful independent study program that served the needs of those most in need. Everybody won. But that didn\u2019t matter.\nFor spurious and ego-driven reasons, this program was dismantled and diminished to a mere shell of its former self. It was replaced by a program that failed after two years. Like prisons, it involves removing those in society with unacceptable behaviors and placing them into a concentrated environment of only themselves.\nIf shooting oneself in the foot was considered a good thing, then FUSD could qualify as a world-class marksman regarding this issue.

{"idx": 29, "truncated_input": "This was Reinsdorf's reply on Friday when asked whether the preseason announcement that Phil Jackson will not return as coach of the Bulls next season is, as the French saying goes, a fact accomplished.\nAnd the notation on the desk of Reinsdorf, the owner of the Chicago Bulls, also indicates his position regarding Michael Jordan's often-stated contention that he will play for no other coach than Jackson, and he will play for no other team than the Bulls, which would mean no Jordan filling up the nets next season.\nThe Bulls make their final regular-season appearance at Madison Square Garden this afternoon against the Knicks, and it seems inconceivable that Jordan will not return for yet another year, and that neither Jackson nor Scottie Pippen will be with the Bulls, either.\nJordan, still the world's greatest hoopster, is leading the National Basketball Association in scoring for the 10th time in his 14 seasons. Even at age 35, he is playing as good an all-round game as ever. Fans, players and team executives know this, so it can hardly be lost on Jordan himself.\nIt is also obvious that His Airness -- a little less airy these days and a little more earthy but ever sovereign -- is having a grand time at his occupation, and satisfying that remarkable lust for competition and success that has made him an indomitable basketball player.\nJordan has changed his mind before, remember. He quit basketball to play baseball and quit baseball to play basketball.\nBut hadn't decisions already been made? As recently as early February, Jerry Krause, the Bulls' general manager, reiterated that Jackson would not return next season, after having led the Bulls to five championships and, if the best-laid plans of Krause and his men do not go awry, to a sixth come June.\nThe personality, or perhaps ego, clash between Jackson and Krause is no secret. While he hired Jackson, Krause also believes that after a certain time, a general manager and a coach may tire of each other, as, has been said, Jerry West and Pat Riley did with the Lakers, thereby compelling a change.\nIn fact, personality clashes between Krause and some of his players, including Pippen and Jordan, and assistant coaches over the years have been no secret. It seems, however, that Krause has had no such conflict with the owner of the team. But it also seems clear that Reinsdorf has sought for Krause and staff to zipper their lips in regard to what may transpire at season's end.\nStill, Reinsdorf's respect for Krause as a basketball operative is lofty, and for good reason. Krause became general manager in 1985, the year after Jordan was drafted. Six seasons later, the Bulls won the first of their championships.\n''Everyone on the first championship team except Jordan was acquired by Krause,'' Reinsdorf said. That included Pippen, astutely attained in a trade for his draft rights and now seemingly headed elsewhere next season as a free agent, although who knows for sure.\nPippen, who will be 33 in September, doesn't talk to Krause, but he does talk to Reinsdorf. And while Pippen is said to be seeking a huge five-year contract, Reinsdorf said he had yet to hear anything like that from Pippen, who has been bitter about what the Bulls have been paying him but has also been making plenty of money with endorsements.\nKrause took a chance on Dennis Rodman.", "baseline_completion": " He found a place for Steve Kerr. He traded a nonentity, Stacey King, for center Luc Longley. He traveled for years to Europe to court Toni Kukoc, and finally snared him. He saw the possibilities in Ron Harper's career being revived.\nYes, Krause has had Jordan all this time, but Jordan found that he couldn't do it alone. He didn't win his first championship until his seventh season in the league -- with a requisite ''supporting cast,'' as Jordan termed it.\nKrause has surely made mistakes, too, such as some draft picks.\nKrause, meanwhile, sometimes says things without a veneer of suavity. He can rankle in his bluntness, or, sometimes, in his evasiveness. And possibly he is frustrated in not receiving much of the due he believes he deserves.\nWhen he received his championship ring for last season along with the rest of the team at the season opener at the United Center, the boos for him were evident. It was odd, since if he had been the general manager of five championships in, say, New York, he could be Mayor of this town -- and on a write-in ballot.\nSo at what point do you make a decision to break up the team?\nLooking at their history, it is manifest that as a twosome neither Krause nor Reinsdorf is so stupid or driven by ego that he will perpetrate the sublimely imbecilic.\nThe view here is that Jordan will definitely be playing next season with the Bulls, with or without Jackson. But the odds of Jackson returning appear healthy, as well, especially if the Bulls win another title.\nIf there is one exception to ''Nothing is written in stone,'' it is this: It's a bottom-line game.", "orig_sample_length": 1202, "prompt_length": 802, "real_completion_length": 400, "no_bl_gen_time": 280.52306723594666, "w_bl_gen_time": 281.9537489414215, "no_bl_output": " He was a rebounding machine, but he was also a rebounding machine with a history of drug abuse and a reputation for being a troublemaker.\n''I'm not sure I would have taken a chance on Rodman,'' Reinsdorf said. ''But Krause did, and it worked out.''\nKrause also took a chance on Toni Kukoc, a Croatian who had never played in the United States. Kukoc has been a good player, but he has not been the player the Bulls thought he would be.\n''Kukoc is a good player, but he's not a great player,'' Reinsdorf said. ''He's not a great player because he's not a great shooter. He's a good shooter, but he's not a great shooter. He's not a great shooter because he's not a great athlete.

Kerr, a 40 percent shooter from 3-point range, has become a key member of the team.\nBut it is Krause's drafts that have been most impressive. He selected Pippen in 1987, Horace Grant in 1987, Toni Kukoc in 1990 and Ron Artest in 1999.\n''Jerry has done a great job,'' Reinsdorf said.

{"idx": 34, "truncated_input": "No, Trump can\u2019t pardon himself. The Constitution tells us so.\nCorrection: An earlier version of this op-ed misspelled the name of former defense secretary Caspar Weinberger. This version has been updated.\nLaurence H. Tribe is the Carl M. Loeb University Professor and Professor of Constitutional Law at Harvard Law School. Richard Painter, a law professor at the University of Minnesota, was chief White House ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush from 2005 to 2007 and is vice-chair of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW). Norman Eisen, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, was chief White House ethics lawyer for President Barack Obama from 2009 to 2011 and is chair of CREW.\nCan a president pardon himself? Four days before Richard Nixon resigned, his own Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel opined no, citing \u201cthe fundamental rule that no one may be a judge in his own case.\u201d We agree.\nThe Justice Department was right that guidance could be found in the enduring principles that no one can be both the judge and the defendant in the same matter, and that no one is above the law.\nThe Constitution specifically bars the president from using the pardon power to prevent his own impeachment and removal. It adds that any official removed through impeachment remains fully subject to criminal prosecution. That provision would make no sense if the president could pardon himself.\nThe pardon provision of the Constitution is there to enable the president to act essentially in the role of a judge of another person\u2019s criminal case, and to intervene on behalf of the defendant when the president determines that would be equitable. For example, the president might believe the courts made the wrong decision about someone\u2019s guilt or about sentencing; President Barack Obama felt this way about excessive sentences for low-level drug offenses. Or the president might be impressed by the defendant\u2019s subsequent conduct and, using powers far exceeding those of a parole board, might issue a pardon or commutation of sentence.\nOther equitable considerations could also weigh in favor of leniency. A president might choose to grant a pardon before prosecution of a person when the president believes that the prosecution is not in the national interest; President Gerald Ford pardoned Nixon in part for this reason.\nOr a president may conclude that even if a person may have committed a crime, he was acting in good faith to protect the national interest; President George H.W. Bush pardoned former defense secretary Caspar Weinberger in the Iran-contra affair in part for this reason.\nIn all such instances, however, the president is acting as a kind of super-judge and making a decision about someone else\u2019s conduct, the justice of someone else\u2019s sentence or whether it is in the national interest to prosecute someone else. He is not making a decision about himself.\nThe Constitution embodies this broad precept against self-dealing in its rule that congressional pay increases cannot take effect during", "baseline_completion": " the Congress that enacted them, in its prohibition against using official power to gain favors from foreign states and even in its provision that the chief justice, not the vice president, is to preside when the Senate conducts an impeachment trial of the president.\nThe Constitution\u2019s pardon clause has its origins in the royal pardon granted by a sovereign to one of his or her subjects. We are aware of no precedent for a sovereign pardoning himself, then abdicating or being deposed but being immune from criminal process. If that were the rule, many a deposed king would have been spared instead of going to the chopping block.\nWe know of not a single instance of a self-pardon having been recognized as legitimate. Even the pope does not pardon himself. On March 28, 2014, in St. Peter\u2019s Basilica, Pope Francis publicly kneeled before a priest and confessed his sins for about three minutes.\nPresident Trump thinks he can do a lot of things just because he is president. He says that the president can act as if he has no conflicts of interest. He says that he can fire the FBI director for any reason he wants (and he admitted to the most outrageous of reasons in interviews and in discussion with the Russian ambassador). In one sense, Trump is right \u2014 he can do all of these things, although there will be legal repercussions if he does. Using official powers for corrupt purposes \u2014 such as impeding or obstructing an investigation \u2014 can constitute a crime.\nBut there is one thing we know that Trump cannot do \u2014 without being a first in all of human history.

Buenaventura said the offer period was moved from the earlier deadline of end-December 2018 as there was \u201cno response so far\u201d from PDS shareholders.\nLast October, Landbank issued a new offer to buy shares at P215 per share, lower than P360 a share previously.\nThe downgraded offer took into account the P600 million in dividends that PDS issued to shareholders in June, even as the share price remained a multiplier of 1.5 times adjusted net asset value or the same as the previous offer.\nThe dividend payouts reduced PDS\u2019s asset value, Buenaventura had noted.\nBuenaventura earlier expressed optimism that a majority or at least 66.67 percent of shareholders would give their acceptance letters to Landbank before yearend to seal the deal and sign share purchase agreements with them.\nDuring the previous offer, 43 percent of shareholders already submitted acceptance letters, such that they expect the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE), banks and investment houses to accept the new offer as well, Buenaventura had said.\nBuenaventura\u2019s plan to acquire a majority stake in PDS runs counter to the planned merger of the latter with the PSE.\nBut Finance Secretary Carlos G. Dominguez III, who chairs Landbank, had lamented that the PSE was not being compliant with the conditions set for its merger with PDS.", "orig_sample_length": 402, "prompt_length": 2, "real_completion_length": 400, "no_bl_gen_time": 231.50889921188354, "w_bl_gen_time": 234.57917165756226, "no_bl_output": "ANILA, Philippines \u2013 The Department of Health (DOH) on Wednesday, August 12, reported 1,000 new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases, bringing the total number of infections in the country to 126,000.\n\nThe DOH said 1,000 of the 12,000 new tests conducted on Tuesday, August 11, were positive.\n\nThe DOH also reported 10 new deaths, bringing the total number of fatalities to 2,245.\n\nThe DOH said 100 more patients have recovered, bringing the total number of recoveries to 72,800.\n\nThe DOH said the country's COVID-19 recovery rate is at 57.7%.\n\nThe DOH said 1,000 of the 12,000 new tests conducted on Tuesday, August 11, were positive.\n\nThe DOH said 100 more patients have recovered, bringing the total number of recoveries to 72,800.\n\nThe DOH said the country's COVID-19 recovery rate is at 57.7%.\n\nThe DOH said the country's COVID-19 recovery rate is at 57.7%.\n\nThe DOH said the country's COVID-19 recovery rate is at 57.7%.\n\nThe DOH said the country's COVID-19 recovery rate is at 57.7%.\n\nThe DOH said the country's COVID-19 recovery rate is at 57.7%.\n\nThe DOH said the country's COVID-19 recovery rate is at 57.7%.\n\nThe DOH", "w_bl_output": "ANCHESTER, England (AP) \u2014 anchester United has appointed former defender Ole Gunnar Solskjaer as its caretaker manager.\n\nThe former United striker, who was at the club between 1996 and 2007, succeeds Jose ourinho, who was fired by the club on Tuesday after a run of poor results.\n\nSolskjaer, who has been in charge of olde since 2011, will take over until the end of the season.\n\n\u201canchester United is in my heart and it\u2019s brilliant to be coming back in this role,\u201d Solskjaer said. \u201cI\u2019m really looking forward to working with the very talented squad we have, the staff and everyone at the club.\u201d\n\nourinho, who was appointed in ay 2016, was sacked after United lost to Liverpool 3-1 at Anfield on Sunday.
