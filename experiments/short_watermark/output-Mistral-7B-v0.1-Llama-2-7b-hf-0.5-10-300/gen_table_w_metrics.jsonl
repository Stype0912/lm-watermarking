{"idx": 1, "truncated_input": "\"Whoever gets him, they'll be getting a good one,\" David Montgomery said.\nINDIANAPOLIS \u2014 Hakeem Butler has been surrounded by some of the best wide receivers on the planet this week at the NFL Scouting Combine.\nIt\u2019s an experience that might humble some. But for Butler, it has only enhanced his confidence.\nAs it stands, 22-year-old Butler is not regarded as the best wide receiver in this year\u2019s NFL Draft. He\u2019s projected by some experts to go as late as the third round. But when wide receivers were measured Thursday, Butler gained some attention: He led all receivers in height (6-foot-5 3/8), arm length (35 1/4 inches) and wingspan (83 7/8 inches).\nOn Thursday, running back David Montgomery, who played with Butler at Iowa State, captured the general vibe surrounding Butler here.\nButler says he\u2019s met with every NFL team on an informal basis. He had \u201cnine or 10\u201d formal meetings set up for Friday night, but didn\u2019t", "baseline_completion": " divulge which teams he\u2019d be sitting down with.\nThere is clear interest in Butler, who declared for the draft after his junior season in which he had 60 receptions for 1,318 yards and nine touchdowns.\nBut in his mind, the hype machine hasn\u2019t been turned up high enough \u2014 yet.\nButler, of course, is talking about Saturday\u2019s wide receiver workouts. If he crushes the drills, he could vault up the draft board \u2014 perhaps into the first round. And he feels well-prepared because he\u2019s spent the past few months working out with some legendary NFL receivers in Calvin Johnson and Anquan Boldin.\nButler met Boldin at the South Florida gym where he trains. He was connected to Johnson through his agent.\nJohnson and Boldin are known for being precise, tactical receivers. But Butler says the most valuable lesson of working with them has been learning about how they think.\nButler admitted the first time he worked with Johnson, who went to six Pro Bowls with the Detroit Lions from 2010-15, that he was a little starstruck.\nButler is hoping that one day he can leave a legacy like Boldin or Johnson. But for now, his goal is to prove what he already believes is true: that he is the top receiver in this draft.", "orig_sample_length": 548, "prompt_length": 248, "real_completion_length": 300, "no_bl_gen_time": 152.77880454063416, "w_bl_gen_time": 153.11749911308289, "no_bl_output": " have any scheduled for Saturday.\n\u201cI\u2019m just going to be here, just in case,\u201d Butler said. \u201cI\u2019m just going to be here, just in case.\u201d\nButler\u2019s size and speed (4.48 40-yard dash) are impressive.

The proposed county incentives are part of an agreement in which Amazon would occupy significant office space and bring at least 25,000 high-paying jobs to Arlington in coming years.\nOpponents hope to postpone the vote until after additional public hearings, where they want representatives of the online retail giant to answer questions directly from anyone in the community.\nThe Saturday hearing was scheduled to begin no earlier than 1 p.m. and last several hours before the vote. Ninety-one people signed up in advance to speak on the topic.\nIn the four months since Arlington won a much-publicized, nationwide contest to attract the facility known as HQ2, Arlington residents have been asking questions about its impact on their community.\nPeople have looked at the county\u2019s five online Q&A sessions 14,000 times, and about 400 attended community events to discuss the provisions in the Amazon agreement. Board members and county staff also met with scores of civic organizations, served on multiple panels and appeared on television, online and in news articles to discuss the deal.\nMost Arlingtonians, northern Virginians and residents of the Washington region support Amazon\u2019s arrival, several surveys have found. Business organizations, universities and nonprofit groups came out strongly for the deal.\nBut a small, vocal group of activists has sought to block the project, saying that the county and commonwealth should not give any incentives to one of the world\u2019s most valuable companies. They also have demanded housing and job protections for existing residents.\nThese opponents \u2014 including left-wing organizations and immigrants groups \u2014 felt empowered after Amazon canceled plans last month to build a headquarters facility in New York City, also with 25,000 jobs. The company withdrew after criticism of the plan from some elected leaders, unions and community activists.\nIn Virginia, however, such opposition did not appear to catch fire among the broader public.\nOfficials estimate that the Amazon project\u2019s net fiscal impact on Arlington could be worth additional revenue of $162 million over 12 years and $392.5 million over 16 years.\nThe incentives agreement promises the world\u2019s largest online retailer cash grants estimated at about $23 million if it occupies 6.05 million square feet of office space in Crystal City and Pentagon City through 2035.\nThe money would come from an expected increase in the hotel, motel and lodging tax paid by visitors; Amazon would get up to 15 percent of that increase, pegged to how much floor space is in active use by the company each year from 2020 to 2035.\nAmaz", "baseline_completion": "on\u2019s offices will be located within an already-established special tax district where a portion of the property tax revenue goes toward infrastructure improvements such as parks and wider sidewalks.\nThe incentive agreement says that half of any new revenue from that district starting in 2021 will go specifically toward improvements around the Amazon buildings for the following 10 years.

Amazon will have a chance to express its opinion on how the county uses the money, although the board will make the decision.\nThe county also offered Amazon the possibility of using its fast, fiber-optic network connection, which would be the subject of a separate agreement if the company chooses to use it.\nIt\u2019s not yet clear whether Amazon will pay the local business license tax because that tax is levied only on certain types of business, and Amazon has not yet announced which of its business units will be based in Arlington.

{"idx": 10, "truncated_input": "This month some important Walmart news did not get the attention it deserved. The news wasn't some flashy announcement about virtual reality or about some new service for busy Manhattanites. It was something much more subtle and much more substantive.\nIt was the hire of Valerie Casey. Google \"Valerie Casey\" even today and only two listings make mention of her newfound connection with Walmart on the first page of the returned search results. This amount of attention is unjustifiably slight. Let this piece then serve as the hire's coming out party.\nShrewdly, Walmart has made Valerie Casey, formerly of Frog, Ideo, and Pentagram, its new head of design. She will be charged with leading Walmart into the future and ensuring that all its products and services, from websites to employee and consumer apps, will work in cohesion and from a singular experience design point of view.\n\"What's the big whup?\" you might ask.\nThe big whup is that this announcement clearly shows that Walmart has jumped feet first into the waters of next generation retailing. Under Doug McMillon's bold leadership, Walmart here again is taking one of the most essential steps to long-term success for any legacy bricks-and-mortar retailer\u2014specifically, redefining how it thinks of the word \"product.\"\nInstead of doing what many retailers do, like staffing de facto \"product\" heads within owned brand development, store operations, e-commerce, etc. and then leaving them to collaborate inside complex organizations with competing priorities, Walmart rightly understands that retailing has become so complex that all these aforementioned roles now need their own steward to ensure alignment.\nWalmart having a mission to help its customers save money and live better is one thing, but putting that promise into coherent action is another thing entirely. Many retailers take such coordinated action for granted, which is why so many legacy retail experiences feel disjointed across the digital and physical divide. Success rarely is found in the compromise and turf wars of internal politics. The buck needs to stop somewhere.\nPrior to e-commerce, before customers had the myriad of options they have today to consume products (via web portals, apps, social media, etc.), retailers were able to differentiate themselves by the products inside their four walls. The strategic practice of product differentiation became so prevalent and such a point of emphasis that it even gave way to the commonly heard parlance of retail being a \"merchant-led business.\"\nThe growth of e-commerce in the 1990s and 2000s rewrote the playbook though. During this period, Jeff Bezos built Amazon into the \"Everything Store.\" His idea was that as long as he could offer a great selection, convenience and great prices, consumers would gravitate towards Amazon over time. Boy, was he right, and, boy, did they ever gravitate towards Amazon.\nWhether customers try to order direct from Amazon or from one of Amazon's many third-party suppliers on its marketplace, it is becoming more and more difficult for a consumer not to find what he or she desires on Amazon. At this point, nearly 50% of all first product searches start on Amazon, indicating that Amazon is settling into the digital and product acquisition-equivalent of the 1980s shopping mall. The products inside a retailers four walls or within a retailers assortment are now, in a way, almost non-differentiating.\nBezos saw that the opportunity in retail was to put the customer first and to think not about the product he or she buys but about the Product he or she really buys\u2014for him, the Product (big \"P) of the Amazon brand. The white space in retail was no longer leading with product (small \"p\"), but leading with the discipline of Product Management, where his Product, or in this case, the Amazon brand, was the magic created at the intersection of great experience design, technology and business. Product was not a pair of khaki pants, a new set of bed sheets or a bar of soap. It was the culmination of a friction-free user experience that delivered on the universal truths of selection, convenience, and low prices and that exceeded consumers' expectations consistently, again and again.\nSadly, many retailers have not grasped this \"Product Problem.\" The greatest Product Manager in history, Jeff Bezos, saw the problem early on, while many merchant princes missed the signals and have even now admitted that they underestimated the impact technology would have on retail. Fortunately, Walmart's recent hire of Casey indicates that there could be light at the end of what has, until now, been a dark tunnel.\nWalmart is big. The acquisitions of Jet.com, Bonobos, ModCloth, etc. have only made it bigger and more complex, saying nothing too of the ever-changing demands of consumers and Walmart's ever-expanding interests abroad (see Flipkart). Therefore, it is only right that someone, like Casey, take up the mantle to oversee and to fight for the consumer and to ensure that all Walmart's activities look, feel, and convey the Walmart brand in the", "baseline_completion": " simplest, most straightforward way as possible.\nThe products inside Walmart's stores are immaterial to its future success. What matters is the Product of its brand\u2014its website, its store, its app-based services, etc. Those are the Products that matter. In a future world where the only thing that differentiates a physical from a digital experience is the memory and delight of being somewhere, a Walmart store is the Product or collective set of experiences that will get someone off his or her couch.\nA tube of toothpaste just won't cut it anymore.\nWhile the products within Walmart's store or on its website will come and go and ebb and flow, the shroud of the Walmart brand will be what matters. Walmart's store and its digital properties will be the envelopes that carry its brand promise.\nThe experiment that bears this out has already been run. We need look no further than the history of Amazon and also to the young upstart CEOs like Emily Weiss, Katrina Lake and Adam Goldenberg who are already thriving in this new world. Their collective early success indicates that they get the punchline to the joke of 21st century retail\u2014that the retail of the future won't be merchant led, it will be Product led.\nBest of luck, Valerie Casey.

In the 18 years she has spent in the design industry she has been at some the most respected design consultancies and design firms, like Fjords, Frog, Ideeo and Pentgram (the last two of these being two of the three design consultancies to have been awarded \"best in the world for design consulting services\" by the Reddot Design Rankings).

{"idx": 12, "truncated_input": "The Linux kernel now includes everything that is needed to use 3D acceleration with all GeForce graphics chips. Drivers have also been added for a Wireless Gigabit chip and a PCIe WLAN chip from Realtek.\nIn his email announcing the release of Linux 3.8-rc6, Linus Torvalds emphasised that he wanted the seventh release candidate to be the last one. When he released RC7 on Friday, however, he made no mention of whether there would be an eighth RC before the final version of Linux 3.8.\nAs long as no more major problems arise, though, the Linux kernel 3.8 should still be released this month. This article on driver updates will therefore bring the \"Coming in 3.8\" Kernel Log mini-series to a close. The first two parts of the series focused on the changes that kernel developers made to filesystems and storage and the platform and infrastructure code for Linux 3.8.\nIn Linux 3.8, the Nouveau kernel driver will include everything that the OpenGL driver \u00e2\u0080\u0093 which is part of current versions of Mesa 3D and is also called Nouveau \u00e2\u0080\u0093 needs to use the 3D acceleration of all GeForce graphics chips available so far without further configuration. This is the first time that the Nouveau developers, who use reverse engineering to get the information they need to program their drivers, have managed this feat; before this, they were still lacking standard 3D support for some newer Fermi GPUs and the Kepler graphics chips, which have been on the market since March 2012 (1, 2, 3). For many computers, however, NVIDIA's proprietary graphics driver will still be a better choice, since Nouveau can't activate the faster operation modes for many of the newer GeForce chips, resulting in 3D performance that leaves something to be desired. There are also other issues, particularly when it comes to video acceleration and fan management support.\nVersion 3.8 of Linux is the first to include a simple kernel graphics driver for the graphics cores in NVIDIA's Tegra\u00c2 2 and 3 SoCs (system on a chip) (1, 2, 3 and others). The driver is not from NVIDIA; it was developed mostly by a developer from the German company Avionic Design. The company works on embedded solutions in close cooperation with NVIDIA and programmed the driver independently, but with input from NVIDIA. Surprisingly, NVIDIA jumped into the development process, publishing extensions a few weeks ago that let the driver make the graphics cores' acceleration features available, but these improvements did not make it into 3.8. Userland drivers are still needed to use the acceleration functions, and NVIDIA has yet to give any indication that it is interested in releasing those drivers under an open source licence. Nouveau developer Lucas Stach shared background information on the Linux drivers for NVIDIA's Tegra in a presentation at FOSDEM 2013, a recording of which is available on YouTube.\nThe Radeon driver now allows more of the graphics cores' DMA engines, which have previously been largely ignored, to be used from userspace (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). The i915 graphics driver now supports by default the graphics cores of the Haswell processors that Intel will introduce under the name Core i4000 in a few months. The developers have also included a workaround for a bug in the Intel 830 and 845 chipsets so the graphics drivers are supposed to be stable on these chipsets.\nThe virtio_net network driver, which uses paravirtualisation and is especially used with KVM and Xen, should provide better performance now that it can use multiple queues for each network device. The same goes for the Tun/Tap driver, which is also used for system virtualisation as well as other purposes like emulating network hardware.\nThe batman-adv (Better Approach To Mobile Ad-Hoc Networking Advanced) mesh implementation developed as part of open-mesh.org to spontaneously create WLAN networks can now build a distributed ARP table, which allows non-mesh clients on a network to receive quick, reliable answers to their ARP queries.\nThe rtl8723ae driver for the Realtek RTL8723AE PCIe WLAN chip is new (1, 2 and others), as is the wil6210 driver for a Wilocity WLAN chip that operates at 60GHz and uses the IEEE 802.11ad standard promoted by the Wireless Gigabit Alliance (WiGig).\nAnother addition to the kernel is the ar5523 driver, which was started over five years ago for the Atheros USB chipset of the same name. Extensions for supporting more chips and WLAN adapters were added to a number of other drivers; the brcmsmac WLAN driver, for example, now supports the BCM43224 Broadcom chip, while the rt2800usb RaLink driver supports the Sweex LW323 USB WLAN adapter.\nThe cdc-mbim driver, which supports broadband modems that implement Mobile Broadband Interface Model (MBIM ) 1.0, specified by the USB Implementers Forum, is also new (1, 2). MBIM is a USB protocol for connecting modems for laptops, tablets and desktop computers that provide an internet connection using GSM and CDMA-based 3G and 4G (including LTE). Aleksander Morgado provides more details on the protocol and its advantages compared to other technologies in a blog post.\nThe kernel's audio drivers now support the Philips PSC724 Ultimate Edge sound card. The kernel can also handle VIA's VT1705CF HD audio codec now.

Extensions were added to the HID multitouch driver to support some of the features for better finger and movement recognition found in Windows\u00c2 8.\nThe drivers for Video4Linux\u00c2 2 (V4L2) located in the media subsystem can now use the \"DMA Buffer Sharing Mechanism\" (dma_buf) integrated in Linux 3.3 to share buffer space with graphics cards, which makes it possible that data from video hardware will no longer need to be duplicated in the buffer in order for a graphics chip to display it.\nThe kernel developers have marked the uas driver, which handles the USB Attached SCSI protocol, as broken because it causes problems and is not yet ready for the major distributions.\nAlan Cox has given up kernel development for family reasons, leaving his position as maintainer of the serial driver subsystem. Cox is a Linux veteran who maintained the Linux kernel 2.2, during which time he was considered the second most important kernel developer after Linus Torvalds. Although he hasn't been that far up in the ranks these last few months, Cox has still contributed quite a lot to the development of Linux.", "orig_sample_length": 1628, "prompt_length": 1328, "real_completion_length": 300, "no_bl_gen_time": 195.65592765808105, "w_bl_gen_time": 196.45610165596008, "no_bl_output": ", too.\nThe kernel's USB subsystem now supports the USB 3.0 SuperSpeed hubs from Intel and NEC.

The eruption, ranked as an X-7, was one of the most powerful in recent times. The flare was accompanied by a coronal mass ejection, which is a colossal discharge of electrified gas called plasma. The event was 5,000 million times more powerful than an atomic bomb.\nScientists don't know exactly what triggers such eruptions. They are associated with strong magnetic fields, however, and emanate from sunspots, which are cooler regions of the Sun that correspond to bottled-up magnetic energy.\n\"Sunspots are at the surface of the Sun, and are essentially the footprints of the magnetic field,\" explained Louise Harra of the Mullard Space Science Laboratory at University College London. \"The magnetic field reaches into the outer atmosphere in the same way as for example a bar magnet has a magnetic field around it.\"\nResearchers had thought the big eruptions are created when magnetic field lines from the core of a sunspot become tangled and reconnect high in solar atmosphere, or corona.

{"idx": 14, "truncated_input": "Last summer I took a cross-country road trip with a group of people driving different types of electric vehicles.\nIt was an amazing experience, and our trip, our adventures, and our misadventures were portrayed in the documentary Kick Gas.\nThat experience gave me the idea to take my own road trip to experience the freedom of traveling alone on an electric motorcycle.\nMy goals were simple: ride the great motorcycle roads of America, meet other electric motorcycle riders, and visit friends.\nThe cross-country trip last summer taught me that charging stations are plentiful near cities, but sparse near the good roads. By \"good roads\" I mean the mountainous, twisty, curvy, windy, fun roads you dream about when buying a motorcycle!\nTo take road trips in an electric vehicle as easily as in a gas-powered vehicle, two things are necessary: a car with a highway range of 150-plus miles, plus DC fast charging available every 50 miles. That would be a good beginning as we await an affordable 1,000-mile battery.\nCurrently drivers must rely on the availability of public and private charging stations to venture further than half the range of their electric vehicle. This creates a bit of an adventure if you want to take a journey of, say, 4,000 miles.\nPublic charging stations are easiest to access. On the East Coast, you can show up at a charging station and pretty much expect that nobody else will be plugged in.\nThat's not the case in California, which has a much higher density of electric vehicles--at least some of them already using the charging station you've just arrived at.\nMy favorite public charging stations are at restaurants, so I have a place to eat and relax while my vehicle is charging. On this trip, I stopped at several Cracker Barrel restaurants in Tennessee and a Makuto's Japanese restaurant in Boone, North Carolina.\nCar dealerships will let motorcycles charge, although not always electric cars of another make. Nissan in particular has outfitted their dealerships with 240-Volt Lvel 2 chargers, and more recently, some of them now have high-powered CHAdeMO DC fast chargers.\nEven dealerships that normally only allow charging by cars sold by that dealer will allow me to plug in my electric motorcycle, since it's unique. Some dealers happily let me charge, others let me charge after a little conversation.\nStill, recharging my electric bike at a car dealer proved less than ideal, since they're often far from food or anywhere interesting to hang out.\nPersonal homes are fun if you plan ahead. I've met some interesting folks who make their home Level 2 charging stations available to travelers by listing them on the PlugShare app. They are lovely people, and meeting them is a fun part of being an early adopter.\nClearly, though, using someone's home charging station is not a sustainable way to propel electric vehicles forward.\nThe fun riding part of my journey began in Front Royal, Virginia, on Skyline Drive going through the Shenandoah Mountains. The road winds its way around the mountaintops and was designed as a sightseeing project by the Civilian Conservation Corps during the Great Depression of the 1930s.\nAfter a great day on Skyline Drive, I got to ride through the back woods around Blacksburg, Virginia, until I reached the glorious Blue Ridge Parkway. The road is absolutely incredible, flowing through farmland and mountains on either side for miles and miles.\nI made a brief stop in Asheville to swing -dance to bluegrass music with friends from Italy; I rode to the top of Mt. Mitchell, and then I headed to the best motorcycle road in America, known as the Dragon.\nAfter riding the Dragon, I headed to Nashville to visit some electric-motorcycle friends, and we headed down the famous Natchez Trace Parkway. This is another phenomenally beautiful road with scenic stops and meandering curves that caress the local terrain.\nThe first half of my journey ended in St. Louis, where I attended my cousin's wedding and visited the Country Music Hall of Fame. My trip was broken up because I had to fly back to New York City for a week, but I'll resume today--traveling to Chicago, Cleveland, and Rochester, New York, on my way to ride up New Hampshire's Mount Washington.\n1) It's still an adventure to take an electric-vehicle road trip (unless you're driving a Tesla using the company's Supercharger network).\n2) While it's easy to find charging stations, they're not always guaranteed to be available. They could be in use already, not working at all, or--worst of all--they might be \"ICEd,\" or blocked by a thoughtless driver of an internal-combust", "baseline_completion": "ion engine (ICE) car.\n3) Most people at RV campgrounds are super-nice! I've shown up to many campgrounds unannounced, and most were incredibly welcoming and let me recharge my motorcycle for free (even though I always offer to pay the dollar or so for the electricity).\n4) To take a road trip in any electric vehicle, you need to plan ahead. At the start of each day, I decided where my stops for charging would be--including alternate locations if available.\n6) A couple of RV parks have claimed that they needed to replace receptacles to their 50-Amp hookup after a Tesla used it. This should be further investigated, as electric-vehicle owners very much don't want to burn those bridges or create any distrust of our community on the part of park owners.\n7) When I learn a Tesla has stopped at an RV park, the park operators will often ask me for $10 or more to recharge (my bike uses maybe $0.60 of electricity). This highlights the fact that most people have no idea how much electricity costs--and no one understands how much electricity different electric vehicles use. My motorcycle battery holds one-tenth the energy of a Tesla battery, so the cost for electricity is a factor of 10 less--but I often have to explain that slowly and carefully.", "orig_sample_length": 1373, "prompt_length": 1073, "real_completion_length": 300, "no_bl_gen_time": 184.29185032844543, "w_bl_gen_time": 105.2705512046814, "no_bl_output": "ion vehicle.\n3) The best charging stations are at restaurants, where you can eat and relax while your vehicle charges.\n4) The best roads are in the mountains, where the scenery is beautiful and the roads are twisty and curvy.\n5) The best roads are in the South, where the weather is warm and the people are friendly.\n6) The best roads are in the South, where the weather is warm and the people are friendly.\n7) The best roads are in the South, where the weather is warm and the people are friendly.\n8) The best roads are in the South, where the weather is warm and the people are friendly.\n9) The best roads are in the South, where the weather is warm and the people are friendly.\n10) The best roads are in the South, where the weather is warm and the people are friendly.\n11) The best roads are in the South, where the weather is warm and the people are friendly.\n12) The best roads are in the South, where the weather is warm and the people are friendly.\n13) The best roads are in the South, where the weather is warm and the people are friendly.\n14) The best roads are in the South, where the weather is warm and the people are friendly.\n15) The best roads are in the South, where the weather is warm and the people are friendly", "w_bl_output": "ion vehicle.\n3) Charging stations can be found anywhere, from the middle- of -no where, to the most urban areas; but they aren\u2019\u2019\u2019t evenly distributed across America.\n\nThe good news is the electric car industry has been working hard to solve these three problems and is close.

{"idx": 19, "truncated_input": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Could the U.S. lose its top credit rating even if a deal is reached to raise the debt limit?\nMarket analysts and investors increasingly say yes. The outcome won't be quite as scary as a default, but financial markets would still take a blow. Mortgage rates could rise. States and cities, already strapped, could find it more difficult to borrow. Stocks could lose their gains for the year.\n\"At this point, we're more concerned about the risk of a downgrade than a default,\" said Terry Belton, global head of fixed income strategy at JPMorgan Chase. In a conference call with reporters Tuesday, Belton said the loss of the country's AAA rating may rattle markets, but it's \"better than missing an interest payment.\"\nEven with a deadline to raise the U.S. debt limit less than a week away, many investors still believe Washington will pull off a last-minute deal to avoid a catastrophic default. Washington has until Aug. 2 to raise the country's $14.3 trillion borrowing limit or risk missing a payment on its debt. President Barack Obama and Congressional Republicans have failed to reach an agreement to raise the debt ceiling and pass a larger budget-cutting package. Politicians have tied raising the debt limit and spending cuts together.\nBut at least one credit rating agency has already made it clear that unless that agreement includes at least $4 trillion in budget cuts over the next decade, the country's AAA rating could be lost. Right now, the proposals under discussion cut around $2 trillion or less.\nStandard & Poor's warned earlier this month that there was a 50-50 chance of a downgrade, if Congress and President Obama failed to find a \"credible solution to the rising U.S. government debt burden.\" S&P said it may cut the U.S. rating to AA within 90 days. Passing a $4 trillion agreement could prevent a downgrade, S&P said.\nThe other chief rating agency, Moody's Investors Service, said the U.S. government would likely keep its top rating if it avoids a default.\nSpokesmen from both Moody's and S&P said they wouldn't comment beyond their recent reports.\nJPMorgan's Belton said clients have started asking how markets will respond if the U.S. loses its AAA rating. A drop to AA will mean permanently higher borrowing costs for the U.S. government, he said. And because government lending rates act as a floor for other lending rates, mortgages, student loans, corporate debt and other types of loans will become more expensive.\nBelton estimates that borrowing costs would rise between 0.60 to 0.70 points. That may not sound like much. But mortgage interest rates, which have hovered around 4.5 percent for the last several weeks, could rise by at least that amount, to more than 5.1 percent.\nAnd for the federal government, it eventually means an extra $100 billion in interest payments to Treasury holders like China each year.\n\"That's a huge number,\" Belton said. That $100 billion a year that could be spent elsewhere on everything from education to infrastructure.\nAn increase in interest rates could soon become a drag on other parts of the economy, experts say. State governments and insurance agencies would also be downgraded \u2014 and states are already having financial troubles. Business confidence could sink again, leading to prolonged high unemployment.\nBut some investors aren't unhappy about the thought of a U.S. debt downgrade. Don Quigley, manager of the $1.5 billion Artio Total Return Bond fund", "baseline_completion": " reasons that such a move could provide a buying opportunity. He believes that a downgrade would immediately send the yield of the 10-year bond up to 3.15 percent from its current level of about 3 percent.\nIf the economy sinks further in part because of higher interest rates, investors would very likely return to buying bonds, Quigley said. That's what they've done during the last several years both during the financial crisis and recession, and again the last several months as the economic recovery has slowed.\nTreasurys would keep their allure, in part, because there are few alternatives for large foreign buyers looking for a market big enough to handle massive investments.\n\"The German market is not big enough and Japan has its own problems,\" Quigley said.\nA cut to the U.S. credit rating could hit stocks harder than bonds. A study by Janney Montgomery Scott looked at rating changes to countries over the past decade. After Spain was downgraded in 2009, Spain's stock market fell 8 percent in three months. A cut to Japan's credit rating in 2011 knocked the country's stock market down 3.4 percent in three months. The study, released in April, suggested the S&P 500 would fall 6% after a U.S. downgrade, erasing all its gains for the year.", "orig_sample_length": 1113, "prompt_length": 813, "real_completion_length": 300, "no_bl_gen_time": 173.4118630886078, "w_bl_gen_time": 54.09095549583435, "no_bl_output": ", said he's been buying Treasurys in anticipation of a downgrade.\n\"I'm not worried about a downgrade,\" Quigley said. \"I'm worried about a default.\"\nQuigley said he's been buying Treasurys because they're still the safest investment in the world.

{"idx": 29, "truncated_input": "This was Reinsdorf's reply on Friday when asked whether the preseason announcement that Phil Jackson will not return as coach of the Bulls next season is, as the French saying goes, a fact accomplished.\nAnd the notation on the desk of Reinsdorf, the owner of the Chicago Bulls, also indicates his position regarding Michael Jordan's often-stated contention that he will play for no other coach than Jackson, and he will play for no other team than the Bulls, which would mean no Jordan filling up the nets next season.\nThe Bulls make their final regular-season appearance at Madison Square Garden this afternoon against the Knicks, and it seems inconceivable that Jordan will not return for yet another year, and that neither Jackson nor Scottie Pippen will be with the Bulls, either.\nJordan, still the world's greatest hoopster, is leading the National Basketball Association in scoring for the 10th time in his 14 seasons. Even at age 35, he is playing as good an all-round game as ever. Fans, players and team executives know this, so it can hardly be lost on Jordan himself.\nIt is also obvious that His Airness -- a little less airy these days and a little more earthy but ever sovereign -- is having a grand time at his occupation, and satisfying that remarkable lust for competition and success that has made him an indomitable basketball player.\nJordan has changed his mind before, remember. He quit basketball to play baseball and quit baseball to play basketball.\nBut hadn't decisions already been made? As recently as early February, Jerry Krause, the Bulls' general manager, reiterated that Jackson would not return next season, after having led the Bulls to five championships and, if the best-laid plans of Krause and his men do not go awry, to a sixth come June.\nThe personality, or perhaps ego, clash between Jackson and Krause is no secret. While he hired Jackson, Krause also believes that after a certain time, a general manager and a coach may tire of each other, as, has been said, Jerry West and Pat Riley did with the Lakers, thereby compelling a change.\nIn fact, personality clashes between Krause and some of his players, including Pippen and Jordan, and assistant coaches over the years have been no secret. It seems, however, that Krause has had no such conflict with the owner of the team. But it also seems clear that Reinsdorf has sought for Krause and staff to zipper their lips in regard to what may transpire at season's end.\nStill, Reinsdorf's respect for Krause as a basketball operative is lofty, and for good reason. Krause became general manager in 1985, the year after Jordan was drafted. Six seasons later, the Bulls won the first of their championships.\n''Everyone on the first championship team except Jordan was acquired by Krause,'' Reinsdorf said. That included Pippen, astutely attained in a trade for his draft rights and now seemingly headed elsewhere next season as a free agent, although who knows for sure.\nPippen, who will be 33 in September, doesn't talk to Krause, but he does talk to Reinsdorf. And while Pippen is said to be seeking a huge five-year contract, Reinsdorf said he had yet to hear anything like that from Pippen, who has been bitter about what the Bulls have been paying him but has also been making plenty of money with endorsements.\nKrause took a chance on Dennis Rodman. He found a place for Steve Kerr. He traded a nonentity, Stacey King, for center Luc Longley. He traveled for years to Europe to court Toni Kukoc, and finally snared him. He saw the possibilities in Ron Harper's career being revived.\nYes, Krause has had Jordan all this time, but Jordan found that he couldn't do it alone. He didn't win his first championship until his seventh season in the league", "baseline_completion": " -- with a requisite ''supporting cast,'' as Jordan termed it.\nKrause has surely made mistakes, too, such as some draft picks.\nKrause, meanwhile, sometimes says things without a veneer of suavity. He can rankle in his bluntness, or, sometimes, in his evasiveness. And possibly he is frustrated in not receiving much of the due he believes he deserves.\nWhen he received his championship ring for last season along with the rest of the team at the season opener at the United Center, the boos for him were evident. It was odd, since if he had been the general manager of five championships in, say, New York, he could be Mayor of this town -- and on a write-in ballot.\nSo at what point do you make a decision to break up the team?\nLooking at their history, it is manifest that as a twosome neither Krause nor Reinsdorf is so stupid or driven by ego that he will perpetrate the sublimely imbecilic.\nThe view here is that Jordan will definitely be playing next season with the Bulls, with or without Jackson. But the odds of Jackson returning appear healthy, as well, especially if the Bulls win another title.\nIf there is one exception to ''Nothing is written in stone,'' it is this: It's a bottom-line game.", "orig_sample_length": 1202, "prompt_length": 902, "real_completion_length": 300, "no_bl_gen_time": 178.02047872543335, "w_bl_gen_time": 113.79639768600464, "no_bl_output": ", and he didn't win his second until his 10th.\nKrause has been a good general manager, and he has been a good general manager for the Bulls.
