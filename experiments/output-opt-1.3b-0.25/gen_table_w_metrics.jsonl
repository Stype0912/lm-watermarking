But for Butler, it has only enhanced his confidence.\nAs it stands, 22-year-old Butler is not regarded as the best wide receiver in this year\u2019s NFL Draft. He\u2019s projected by some experts to go as late as the third round. But when wide receivers were measured Thursday, Butler gained some attention: He led all receivers in height (6-foot-5 3/8), arm length (35 1/4 inches) and wingspan (83 7/8 inches).\nOn Thursday, running back David Montgomery, who played with Butler at Iowa State, captured the general vibe surrounding Butler here.\nButler says he\u2019s met with every NFL team on an informal basis. He had \u201cnine or 10\u201d formal meetings set up for Friday night, but didn\u2019t divulge which teams he\u2019d be sitting down with.\nThere is clear interest in Butler, who declared for the draft after his junior season in which he had 60 receptions for 1,318 yards and nine touchdowns.\nBut in his mind, the hype machine hasn\u2019t been turned up high enough \u2014 yet.\nButler, of course, is talking about Saturday\u2019s wide receiver workouts. If he crushes the drills, he could vault up the draft board \u2014 perhaps into the first round. And he feels well-prepared because he\u2019s spent the past few months working out with some legendary NFL receivers in Calvin Johnson and Anquan Boldin.\nButler met Boldin at the South Florida gym where he trains.

{"idx": 3, "truncated_input": "The Arlington County Board plans to vote Saturday afternoon on giving Amazon $23 million and other incentives to build a headquarters campus in Crystal City, but only after hearing scores of northern Virginia residents and advocates testify for or against the project.\nThe five-member board is expected to support the plan, which was announced amid much hoopla on Nov. 13. The proposed county incentives are part of an agreement in which Amazon would occupy significant office space and bring at least 25,000 high-paying jobs to Arlington in coming years.\nOpponents hope to postpone the vote until after additional public hearings, where they want representatives of the online retail giant to answer questions directly from anyone in the community.\nThe Saturday hearing was scheduled to begin no earlier than 1 p.m. and last several hours before the vote. Ninety-one people signed up in advance to speak on the topic.\nIn the four months since Arlington won a much-publicized, nationwide contest to attract the facility known as HQ2, Arlington residents have been asking questions about its impact on their community.\nPeople have looked at the county\u2019s five online Q&A sessions 14,000 times, and about 400 attended community events to discuss the provisions in the Amazon agreement. Board members and county staff also met with scores of civic organizations, served on multiple panels and appeared on television, online and in news articles to discuss the deal.\nMost Arlingtonians, northern Virginians and residents of the Washington region support Amazon\u2019s arrival, several surveys have found. Business organizations, universities and nonprofit groups came out strongly for the deal.\nBut a small, vocal group of activists has sought to block the project, saying that the county and commonwealth should not give any incentives to one of the world\u2019s most valuable companies. They also have demanded housing and job protections for existing residents.\nThese opponents \u2014 including left-wing organizations and immigrants groups \u2014 felt empowered after Amazon canceled plans last month to build a headquarters facility in New York City, also with 25,000 jobs. The company withdrew after criticism of the plan from some elected leaders, unions and community activists.\nIn Virginia, however, such opposition did not appear to catch fire among the broader public.\nOfficials estimate that the Amazon project\u2019s net fiscal impact on Arlington could be worth additional revenue of $162 million over 12 years and $392.5 million over 16 years.\nThe incentives agreement promises the world\u2019s largest online retailer cash grants estimated at about $23 million if it occupies 6.05 million square feet of office space in Crystal City and Pentagon City through 2035.\nThe money would come from an expected increase in the hotel, motel and lodging tax paid by visitors; Amazon would get up to 15 percent of that increase, pegged to how much floor space is in active use by the company each year from 2020 to 2035.\nAmazon\u2019s offices will be located within an already-established special tax district where a portion of the property tax revenue goes toward infrastructure improvements such as parks and wider sidewalks.\nThe incentive agreement says that half of any new revenue from that district starting in 2021 will go specifically toward improvements around the Amazon buildings for the following 10 years. That grant is worth an estimated $28 million but the county says it\u2019s not a grant just for Amazon, because the improvements will benefit other companies in the immediate area. Amazon will have a chance to express its opinion on how the county uses the money, although the board will make the decision.\nThe county also offered Amazon the possibility of using its fast, fiber-optic network connection, which would be the subject of a separate agreement if the company chooses to use it.\nIt\u2019s not yet clear whether Amazon will pay the local business license tax", "baseline_completion": " because that tax is levied only on certain types of business, and Amazon has not yet announced which of its business units will be based in Arlington.
